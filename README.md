# Url-Shortener

A url/file-shortener which allows users to create shortcodes for URLS and files. This application helps reduce long links and file names, resulting in easier accessibility to the user's favorite websites and files. 

This project was made to sharpen my understanding of python and flask, and was beautifully templated using html/css, bootstrap, jquery, and jinja2.
