# Url-Shortener

This URL/file shortener allows users to create shortcodes for URLS/files of their choice. This helps reduce long links and confusing file names, resulting in easier accessibility to the user's favorite websites and files.

This application was made to help sharpen my understanding of python and flask, and was beautifully templated using html/css, bootstrap, and jinja2.
